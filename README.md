# Glitched
I created a short horror game for Billy's Basement Game Jam. The game was developed by me on Unity 2021.1.1.13f1, the textures were painted by my friend .

If you want to run it through Unity, use version 2021.1.1.13f1.

If you want to play the game itself, use the latest release.
You can also download the game from Itch.io and Gamejolt.
